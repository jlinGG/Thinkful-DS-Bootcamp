    "## Processing and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a two-part problem: \n",
    "- Process the data from its original form (blocks of text or speech) into a form the computer can understand\n",
    "- Conduct analysis on the processed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step one, which we will address in this assignment, may involve elements of data cleaning and feature extraction. When dealing with verbal information, this step is called _language parsing_.  Domain knowledge (information about word frequency, meaning, and grammar) is applied to raw text to extract features of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with two different NLP packages: [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io).  \n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK, or Natural Language ToolKit, is a seasoned package with great richness and depth. It is good for learning language parsing because it is _highly customizeable and transparent._ On the other hand, it also contains many older models and methods that are useful for teaching NLP but are _not optimal for production code_. \n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is almost the direct opposite. Rather than offering language parsing options, spaCy just processes text data using whatever algorithms and methods are considered \"state of the art\". It is considerably _leaner,_ and because it is written in Cython (meaning Python code is translated into C and then run), it is considerably _faster_. On the other hand, we _lose the virtue of choice_, and if spaCy's algorithms change, our results could change as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll use some of the text corpora (bodies of text) from NLTK, but will process them with spaCy. We'll also use regular expressions (the standard library package `re`) when we want to pull a very specific element of text out of a string, usually before passing the text to spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin. First, if you haven't used NLTK yet, you'll want to install the package with `pip install nltk`. Then, run the cell below to launch an [interactive installer](http://www.nltk.org/data.html#interactive-installer). Using the installer, choose the \"corpora\" tab and download the \"gutenberg\" and \"stopwords\" corpora."

One class of potentially-uninformative tokens is _stop words_, words used very frequently that don't have much informational value, such as \"the\" and \"of\". Some NLP approaches discard stop words, while other approaches retain them because stop words can make up part of meaningful phrases (\"master of the universe\" being more specific and informative than \"master\" and \"universe\" alone)."
