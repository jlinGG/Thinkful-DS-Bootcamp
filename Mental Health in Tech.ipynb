    "The main component of this capstone is an experimentation RFC. Using the data set you selected, propose and outline an experiment plan. The plan should consist of three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis that highlights your experimental hypothesis.\n",
    "- A rollout plan showing how you would implement and rollout the experiment\n",
    "- An evaluation plan showing what constitutes success in this experiment\n",

    "Your experiment should be as real as possible. Though you obviously will not have access to the full production environment to deploy your experiment, it should be feasible and of interest to the parties involved with your actual data source."

    "#### Z-Test conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Respondents who have sought mental health treatments are significantly more likely to say that their employers offer mental health benefits and care options.  Comparing proportional differences of respondents who have access to mental health benefits and those who do not, respondents with access are 15.54% more likely to have sought mental health treatment.  Comparing the differences of respondents with access to care options and those who do not, repondents with access are 27.8% more likely to have sought mental health treatment.  The pvalues are both medical benefits and care options are statistically significant at 5.6e-06 and 0.0, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results could signify that respondents who need mental health services are more aware of the mental health benefits offered by their workplaces.  Or, it could mean that workplaces that offer mental health services are more likely to have employees that seek mental health treatment.  Because this is a survey, it is impossible to establish temporality. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, z-tests show that the proportional differences for those who have sought mental health treatment and if their workplaces offered mental health wellness programs and resources to seek help were not statistically significant.  It is worth noting that most respondents said that their workplaces do not offer wellness programs or mental health resources, compared to mental health benefits and care options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Don't Know\" and \"Not Sure\" responses also make up a good proportion of the response data, so we are going to get less definitive answers as to whether or not having more mental health support is correlated with more employees seeking out mental health treatment.  Which cases is this the most signiicance.  Include the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to run an experiment to determine: \n",
    "1. If a company adopts a mental health wellness program, would employees use the services?  \n",
    "2. Given that employees are utilizing mental health services, would overall job satisfaction and productivity improve?"

    "## Mental Health in Tech: Experimentation RFC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Our theoretical company, BookFace, is concerned about the mental health of their employees.  Currently, BookFace offers employees health insurance and provide physical wellnesss programs that promotes exercise and healthy eating.  While health insurance include mental health benefits and care options, some members of the leadership team believe that more can be done to support their employees' mental wellness.  Of course, robust mental health programs means additional costs.  It is important to learn whether or not such a program would bring additional employee satisfaction and productivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, they designed a mental health experiment to determine \n",
    "    1. What would usage of mental health services may look like?\n",
    "    2. How mental health benefits could improve overall job satisfaction and productivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, they will implement a mental health wellness program in randomly selected offices in North America. They will measure employee sick days as a proxy for productivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment overivew:\n",
    "\n",
    "BookFace has 30 locations across North America.  16 of these locations will be randomly assigned to either the test or control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "For offices in the control group, employees will learn about their current health benefits, including any mental health service offerings with their health insurance plan.  To insure similarities across control offices, employees would be shown an informational video during a staff meeting and reminded that the office HR representative will be available to answer any questions publically or privately.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Offices in the test group will adopt a more comprehensive mental health wellness program.  This program includes a \"wellness week,\" in which leadership and employees openly discuss and address mental health issues in the workplace to combat stigma around mental health conditions.  For the duration of the experiment, a mental health professional will be available to the staff, offering three free counselling session.  Employees will be insured that the names of the clients and the nature of the visit will be kept confidential.  BookFace will also be offering biweekly meditation sessions for staff members.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "Average of employee sick days will drop for test groups relative to that of control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis:\n",
    "There is no difference in the change of average employee sick days between test and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success metrics\n",
    "Primary success metric:  Change in average number of sick days.\n",
    "Secondary metrics:  Number of visits to mental health professional (Validation/Manipulation check).  [Employee satisfaction survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Job-Satisfaction-Survey-Template).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A/A Testing with smaller test group\n",
    "To work out any potential issues in implementation, we would first need to test the program on two test offices and two control offices.  By implementing A/A testing, we could compare the results between the two test office and between the control offices to identify any biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Elements of the experiment we would check for include:\n",
    "    - The content provided\n",
    "    - The amount of notice given to the offices to prepare for the experiment\n",
    "    - The date and time the experiment is run\n",
    "    - How the experiment fits into the normal work schedule (contextual bias)\n",
    "    - Office size and location to assess any sampling biases\n",
    "    - Demographic information of employees to asses any sampling biases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline\n",
    "Week 0 - Send employee satisfaction survey for baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 1 - Implement AA test for 2 test groups and 2 control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 2 - Wellness Week for test group concludes.  Start evaluating results of AA test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 3 - Expand experiment to 6 additional test groups and 6 control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 4 - Wellness Week concludes for test groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "End of experiment (6 months) - Send out satisfaction survey again \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation plan\n",
    "We will be using average sick days to determine if implementing a wellness program has increase workplace productivity.  We will calcuate the change in sick days for each office before and after experiment, being sure we are comparing similar time periods (e.g. If the experiment is run from January 2018 - June 2018, we would compare average sick days during this time period with that of January 2017 - June 2018).  Using a t-test, if the change in average sick days is statistically significant between test and control groups, we can rule out the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be comparing results of the employee satisfaction survey before and after to experiment to determine if employees in the test group are more satisfied with their workplace that employees in the control group by the end of the experiment.  It is important to beware of the [Hawthorne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect), in which individuals may modify their answers in response to their awareness of being observed.  With the test group undergoing a more intensive experience, it would not be surprising to see this reflected in the Employee Satisfaction survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would be unable to note whether or not employees in the control group sought mental health treatment after they were shown the informational video.  For the test groups, we would ask the mental health professionals how many employees have sought their services and how many sessions were scheduled and attended.  For confidentiality, we will not be collecting information on the names of the employees and the content of those sessions.  "
