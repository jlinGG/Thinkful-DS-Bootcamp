    "\n",
    "The main component of this capstone is an experimentation RFC. Using the data set you selected, propose and outline an experiment plan. The plan should consist of three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis that highlights your experimental hypothesis.\n",
    "- A rollout plan showing how you would implement and rollout the experiment\n",
    "- An evaluation plan showing what constitutes success in this experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your experiment should be as real as possible. Though you obviously will not have access to the full production environment to deploy your experiment, it should be feasible and of interest to the parties involved with your actual data source."
